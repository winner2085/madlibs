print(f"""This is the beginning where a {adjective1} {object1} lies in {name1}'s backyard.
    He watches the object with a {drink1} cup in his hand, wondering how got here.
    He thinks of {name2}, his neigbor, and their {adjective2} {animal1} that likes to sneak into his yard.
    But the object was too {adjective3} for a pet to bring in, so he examines the sky, a long-shot, but as he was looking, he noticed a {noun1} against the blue.
    {name1} {verb1} to try and get a better look and sees as the {noun1} is getting closer, and it was {adjective4}.
    He {verb2} as fast as he could back to the house and as he was reaching for the door, he heard a {sound1} from behind him and the whole ground shook.
    {name1} didn't want to look back, but if there was something in his backyard, he was {feeling1}.
    He turned around and saw the {noun1}, {adjective5} and {adjective6}.
    He heard his wife calling out for him as he {adverb1} got closer to the {noun1}.
    {name3} was yelling and telling him to go to the {transportation1} while she grabbed the {pluralnoun1}, but {name1} couldn't stop staring at it.
    Why was a {noun1} in his backyard and what did it have to do with a {adjective1} {object1}?
    Only when he looked at the sky again because of a sound, did he realize what was happening.
